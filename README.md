## Using the Sample App Repository for filing support issues

If you have a bug within your own application, the SampleRepository is a great way to help isolate the issue to Ooyala code. we recommend the following steps.

1. Isolate the bug to the Ooyala Sample repo.
  1. Clone the repository onto your computer
  1. Modify one of the sample as necessary to simulate your application's behavior.
  1. Host and register the receiver sample app
1. If you were able to successfully isolate the issue to our sample app, provide us the repo with your changes
  1. Provide the Receiver APP ID when you create a ticket to Support

## Caveats
Not all of the Ooyala functionality is represented in this repository; We are constantly adding and updating, with the intention of demonstrating as many of our features as possible. If you would like to see something added, speak to your Ooyala contact or Technical Support

We do not recommend testing on any branch that is not master. These branches are not verified to be working as expected.
